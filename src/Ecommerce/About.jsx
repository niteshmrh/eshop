          Even if you cannot change all the people around you, you can change
          the people you choose to be around. Life is too short to waste your
          time on people who don’t respect, appreciate, and value you. Spend
          your life with people who make you smile, laugh, and feel loved.
        </p>

        <p>
          You cannot control the behavior of others, but you can always choose
          how you respond to it.
        </p>

        <p>
          Don't be afraid of your fears. They're not there to scare you. They're
          there to let you know that something is worth it.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you want to forget something or someone, never hate it, or never
          hate him/her. Everything and everyone that you hate is engraved upon
          your heart; if you want to let go of something, if you want to forget,
          you cannot hate.
